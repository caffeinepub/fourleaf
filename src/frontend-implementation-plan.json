Keep LoginButton right-aligned using justify-between (remove the current spacer div), preserve the existing onClick behavior that opens the mobile LeftSidebar drawer, keep the hamburger hidden on md+ as it is now, and continue using the existing icon asset path /assets/generated/hamburger-menu.dim_24x24.svg with an aria-label (e.g., \"Open menu\"). Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
