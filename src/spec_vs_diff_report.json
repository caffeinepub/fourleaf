  "summary": "REQ-1/2/4/5 appear implemented via a persistent flex row layout (sidebar + main), fixed 250px sidebar with shrink-0, sticky pinned sidebar behavior, consistent dark card styling, and horizontal overflow enabled on the main content. REQ-3 (specifically improving UI Sound Effects panel control touch targets) is not evidenced. REQ-6 is only partially evidenced: LoginButton is right-aligned in the main header, but Upload Track alignment changes on pages are not shown in the provided diffs.",

      "reason": "Nav items were adjusted (min-h-[44px], responsive text), but there is no evidence of any changes to the UI Sound Effects panel controls themselves (UISoundControls) to improve mobile touch targets/padding/font sizing.",

      "reason": "AppLayout shows the LoginButton right-aligned in a header within the main content area, but the diff content for LibraryPage/MyLibraryPage is truncated and does not show concrete layout/class changes for the Upload Track button positioning to verify it won’t overlap the pinned sidebar on narrow widths.",
