  "summary": "Core three-panel layout components were added (LeftSidebar, RightDetailsPanel) and AppLayout/LibraryPage/CatalogSongRowCard were updated toward the Spotify-style shell and tracklist. However, the mobile/responsive navigation accessibility and the exact required nav items are not fully met, and several unrelated functional enhancements were introduced beyond the layout-only request.",
