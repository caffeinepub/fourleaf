  "summary": "LeftSidebar was updated to add a hamburger toggle button left of the Fourleaf brand, introduce a collapsed desktop width with smooth transitions and reduced-motion fallbacks, and add ARIA attributes to the toggle. However, the diff summary does not show the requested update to the hamburger SVG asset styling, and some additional/unrequested project/meta files were modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update the hamburger icon asset/visual styling to exactly three thick horizontal bars with rounded ends in the vibrant green accent (e.g., #22c55e), remaining crisp around ~24px.",
      "reason": "LeftSidebar now renders an <img> pointing to the hamburger SVG path, but the diff summary shows no change to the SVG asset itself (no asset file modified/added), so the requested three-thick-bar rounded green styling cannot be verified as implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/layout/LeftSidebar.tsx (uses \"/assets/generated/hamburger-menu.dim_24x24.svg\")",

      "description": "Desktop-only visibility for the hamburger collapse toggle (hidden on mobile).",
      "reason": "The requirement asks for the hamburger in the sidebar header to act as the toggle, without specifying it should be restricted to desktop only. The diff makes the new toggle `hidden md:flex`, implying it will not appear on mobile.",
